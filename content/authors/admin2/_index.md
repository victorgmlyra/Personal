    summary: |
      Mainly focus on industrial manufacturing tasks, but also consider tasks within service robotics and robotics for medical applications. The topics were taught by leading Danish and international scientists. There will also be company presentations from the Odense Robotics Cluster and entrepreneur contributions outlining experiences with starting a knowledge based robotic company.

      Obtained knowledge of state-of-the-art technologies such as:

      - Digital twins and simulations for robotic systems 
      - Offline planning of collision free and feasible robot motions 
      - Modeling and control of robots and robotic systems  
      - Computer Vision and Robot-Vision Systems 
      - Intelligent Human-Robot Interaction

    summary: |
      The Deep Learning Specialization is designed to prepare learners to participate in the development of cutting-edge AI technology, and to understand the capability, the , and the consequences of the rise of deep learning. Through five interconnected courses, learners develop a profound knowledge of the hottest AI algorithms, mastering deep learning from its foundations (neural networks) to its industry applications (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, etc.).
  - title: Self-Driving Cars
    url: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars
    date: '2020-06-26'
    awarder: Coursera

    summary: |
      This Specialization gives you a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the self-driving car industry. By interacting with real data sets from an autonomous vehicle (AV), you’ll implement methods for static and dynamic object detection, localization and mapping, behaviour and maneuver planning, and vehicle control ― all through hands-on projects using the open source simulator CARLA. You’ll learn from a highly realistic driving environment that features 3D pedestrian modeling and environmental conditions. When you complete the Specialization successfully, you’ll be able to build your own selfdriving software stack and be ready to apply for jobs in the autonomous vehicle industry.
