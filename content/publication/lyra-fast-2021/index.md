abstract: With the growth of access to faster computers and more powerful cameras,
  the 3D reconstruction of objects has become one of the public's main topics of research
  and demand. This task is vigorously applied in creating virtual environments, creating
  object models, and other activities. One of the techniques for obtaining 3D features
  is photogrammetry, mapping objects and scenarios using only images. However, this
  process is very costly and can be pretty time-consuming for large datasets. This
  paper proposes a robust, efficient reconstruction pipeline with a low runtime in
  batch processing and permissive code. It is even possible to commercialize it without
  the need to keep the code open. We mix an improved structure from motion algorithm
  and a recurrent multi-view stereo reconstruction. We also use the Point Cloud Library
  for normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and texture mapping. We compare our
  results with state-of-the-art techniques using benchmarks and our datasets. The
  results showed a decrease of 69.4% in the average execution time, with high quality
  but a greater need for more images to achieve complete reconstruction.
